Vernacular districts are informal areas of a city, shaped by the people who live there through their everyday lives. These districts don’t follow official boundaries, and their names and locations are based on how people see and experience the city. \nAs mentioned earlier, we had to pick a city to map its vernacular districts. I chose the city of Tver (Tver Oblast, Russia). All the data were obtained by interviewing local residents.\n\n\nUsed software: QGIS (data processing, maps and layout);\nRole: Author\nPNG Version"

I’ve been keen on geography since I was a child, that’s why I once decided to connect my life and potential career with spatial data. My undergraduate thesis are connected with DEM analysis but I’m also extremely enthusiastic about spatial data visualization and other aspects of cartography & geoinformatics. I also have some experience in field surveys including usage of UAVs — you can read about my expeditions in my CV below.\n\n\n  \n     Download PDF"
