This section contains some of the projects that I carried out either independently or as part of a ✨group✨. Due to the fact that most of the projects are student practical works, they were done in Russian language

# Cartography {#sec-cartography}

## Denmark Population Map {#sec-denmark-population-map}

![The task was to create two pages from the “Population” section that could be placed in a national atlas (country of choice). My idea was to show both: some spatial data (by municipalties) and other statistics (population pyramid & histograms)](images/ENG_Population_map_Denmark_MAIN.png){fig-align="right"}

[Used software]{.underline}: *QGIS* (data processing, maps, layout) + *matplotlib* (graphs);

[Role]{.underline}: Author

[PDF Version](files/ENG_Population_map_Denmark_MAIN.pdf) / [PNG Version](images/ENG_Population_map_Denmark_MAIN.png)

## Landscape Map (Pustozersk, Russia) {#sec-landscape-map}

![The task was to map vegetation associations based on field surveys (that included UAV surveys and field researches).](images/Landscape_Map_Pustozersk_wno_legend.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

[Used software]{.underline}: *QGIS* (data processing, map) + *Adobe Illustrator* (layout);

[Role]{.underline}: Co-Author

## Hypsometry Map of Rep. Adygea {#sec-hypsometry-map-of-rep.-adygea}

![The task was to map topography of a particular Russia region (Rep. of Adygea). Data for hypsometric curve (bottom left) was derived from DEM using WBT and then post-processed and visualized with Python packages.](images/Hypsometry_Adygea.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

[Used software]{.underline}: *QGIS* (data processing, map) + *WhiteBoxTools*, *matplotlib* (hypsometric curve) *Adobe Illustrator* (layout);
