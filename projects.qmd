This section highlights a selection of projects I have undertaken, both independently and as part of some ✨team✨. Since most of these projects were completed as part of my academic coursework, they are primarily documented in Russian.

# Cartography {#sec-cartography}

## Denmark Population Map {#denmark-population-map}

<p style="font-size: 16.5px; color: #888888;">

The goal of this project was to create two pages for the "Population" section of a national atlas, focusing on a country of my choice. My concept involved presenting a combination of spatial data, visualized at the municipality level, alongside complementary statistical insights, such as population pyramids and histograms. This approach aimed to provide a comprehensive and visually engaging representation of demographic information.

## Vernacular Districts of Tver

<p style="font-size: 16.5px; color: #888888;">

For this task, we needed to map the vernacular districts of a chosen city. First, let’s explain the main idea. Vernacular districts are informal areas of a city, shaped by the people who live there through their everyday lives. These districts don’t follow official boundaries, and their names and locations are based on how people see and experience the city. 
As mentioned earlier, we had to pick a city to map its vernacular districts. I chose the city of Tver (Tver Oblast, Russia). All the data were obtained by interviewing local residents.

```{=html}
<p style="font-size: 16.5px; color: #888888;">

The task was to map topography of a particular Russia region (Rep. of Adygea). Data for hypsometric curve (bottom left) was derived from DEM using WBT and then post-processed and visualized with Python packages.
