I am currently a 4th year undergraduate student pursuing a bachelor degree in Cartography and Geoinformatics at Lomonosov Moscow State University (Faculty of Geography). I’ve been keen on geography since I was a child, that’s why I once decided to connect my life and potential career with spatial data. My undergraduate thesis are connected with DEM analysis but I’m also extremely enthusiastic about spatial data visualization and other aspects of cartography & geoinformatics. I also have some experience in field surveys including usage of UAVs — you can read about my expeditions in my CV below.\n\n\n  \n     Download PDF"
